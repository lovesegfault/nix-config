Subject: [PATCH 4/8] drivers: bcm283x: don't explicitly disable init

It seems that the reason why init doesn't succeed is the lack of clock
support in U-Boot. Setting the default clock of 48MHz for the PL011
UARTs makes reinitialization work consistently.

Note that for the first UART the "skip-init" is anyways set in the
device tree. This will only affect probing of UARTs not enabled by
firmware.
